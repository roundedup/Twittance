# Twittance

[Twittance](http://www.twittance.com) is a webapp that predicts political orientation of 
Twitter accounts on a given topic and suggests targeted advertisement. It uses two different vectorizations of tweets, one based on word2vec, 
one on tf-idf. It was trained on a large dataset of tweets by politicians. 
Deployed through Flask, currently hosted on AWS.
